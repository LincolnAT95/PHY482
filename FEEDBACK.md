## Assignment 1

Todd, this is really cool and something I hadn't heard of. I am excited to see what you come up with. I will say that the papers and books you have found are pretty desnse, so let me suggest that you focus on the introductory chapters of one book for next week rather than trying to digest too much. If you can summarize a few key chapters from one of these books (maybe the Barrett one?) that should help you start to focus your work a bit more.

* Score: 20/20
